## Barbarian

Killing your enemy before they get another round is the strongest thing you can do in Pathfinder. The Barbarian excels at this. While bodies piling up at your feet is AWESOME, the best part of the class is you get to do it in style. The Instincts you can pick from really push you into badass levels of AWESOME.

## Animal Instinct
You Rage and become a rampaging animal-like madman. Oh and if you aren’t happy being animal-like, we’ve got feats to transform you into an actual animal. While you’re an animal, you might as well use your ridiculous attack and damage bonuses. It’s straight-up insane.

The animal attacks are all really great too. Most have either the Grapple or Trip trait which makes sure you are always top-tier at using Combat Maneuvers.

You also have one of the best Raging Resistances too. Piercing and Slashing are the two most common damage types (Jaws and Claws respectively). Your Armor Class gets a buff from Animal Skin that keeps you in line with other martials. It's just the cherry on top.

You have crazy flexibility with the Animal Instinct and it’s AWESOME.

### Dragon Instinct
I’m sorry for introducing this to you. It sucks you won’t be able to play anything else when you find out you can transform into a literal Dragon.

You start off with the Dragon’s Breath Weapon infused into your literal sword, burning through elemental weaknesses. Then you get the ability to fire the Breath Weapon at enemies. Then you get the ability to Fly with Dragon Wings. Finally, you become a literal Dragon. It’s AWESOME.

There's nothing more for me to say. It's just plain AWESOME.

## Fury Instinct
Fury gets you off the ground faster with an extra bonus feat. All of the other Instincts have an Anathema they need to worry about. Animals can’t use weapons, Dragons can just die if a powerful enemy challenges them, Giants are the same, Spirits don’t let you loot from the dead and Superstition literally forgoes any magic (including healing).

You’re so AWESOME, you don’t care about that. Just enjoy your massive damage and have fun beating your own drum.

## Giant Instinct
Wielding comically large weapons is AWESOME. There is no way around it. You start at Level 1 with the same bonus Rage damage as a Level 7 Fury Barbarian. You get the highest possible Rage damage of any of the Instincts and you can transform into a literal Giant version of yourself. Having a massive Greatsword that can reach into a different zip code is amazingly powerful. The Barbarian’s mission is to end the fight as fast as possible and you do this swimmingly.


### Spirit Instinct
Undead are a pain in the butt. You don’t even give them the time of day. The Spirit Barbarian is an Undead killing machine. Even ghosts don’t have protection from you and your ability to do positive and negative damage means that you often won’t face Resistances.

Having Resistances from all attacks and abilities from Undead creatures is AWESOME. They are nasty and you put them in their place. Enjoy smashing some skulls.

## Superstition Instinct
The Superstition Instinct is one of the greatest risk/reward builds in the game and if you’re playing a Barbarian, you probably like risk/reward mechanics. They get a bonus to all saves against magic (pretty much every save is magic) and they get the ability to heal when they start Raging.

I haven’t talked about Feats much on the Barbarian because they are AWESOME without even getting into Feats, but Mage Hunter and Sunder Spell are particularly AWESOME. Mage Hunter lets you use a reaction to fight back against spell casters. There are some spell casters in the late game like the infamous Demilich that cast without somatic components. You don’t care and can cleave through them anyways. Sunder Spell lets you put an end to shenanigans before they even start. Goodbye Wall of Force, goodbye Black Tentacles. Putting an end to the boss’s primary ability is just plain AWESOME.

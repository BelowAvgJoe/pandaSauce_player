## The Champion

I’m only going to talk about the good Champions here (if you want me to talk about the others, let me know), but that’s okay because they are just oozing with AWESOME. First off, all Champions are holy Warriors who have insane AC. Your enemies are better off trying to attack a piece of dust in a hurricane than hit you.

So instead of hitting you, they’ll just go around you and attack your friends, right? WRONG. You’ve got three different Causes all dedicated to making sure they don’t get away with that.

### Paladin Cause

The Paladin is the most straightforward of all of the answers. Hit my friend and I will whack you. You literally get to play “Stop Hitting Yourself” with the enemies. The Paladin is the highest damage dealer of the bunch and gets a bunch of feats to just wreck evil enemies. If that wasn’t enough, you get to give out free attacks to your allies just adding to the dogpile.

### Redeemer Cause

The Redeemer is all about giving your opponent hard choices. The hard choice in this scenario is “Do you want your attack to do literally nothing or have your future attacks weakened/lose the ability to cast spells?”. It’s beautiful. The Redeemer can really lay the conditions on thick.

Also worth mentioning that the Oaths for the Redeemer are amazing! If you’re playing something like Malevolence with a ton of Aberrations running around, being able to block 10 damage per Reaction at Level 3 with Esoteric Oath is AWESOME.

### Liberator Oath

In Pathfinder Combat, the best possible defense you can have is not being in range of your opponent. The Liberator Oath can help your friends get out of the jaws of a foe AND step out of danger.

The Level 11 Upgrade is also amazing. Being able to move the entire party without them using a Reaction is insanely strong. When you gain the ability to make multiple reactions per turn, you can just shift the entire battlefield around in one turn.

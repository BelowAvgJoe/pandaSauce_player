## Sorcerer

So full disclosure, the Sorcerer is an AWESOME class that I’m not going to be able to do justice to. They have too many Bloodlines for me to do more than a quick look on. This is sad because the Sorcerer was the first class I ever played in the Playtest and I loved it. The biggest thing to know about picking a Bloodline is that you are picking a Tradition as well. Think long and hard about what you want to do with your spells. There isn’t a wrong choice but there are wrong choices FOR YOU. Find the tradition that makes you feel AWESOME.

Okay, Bloodline rapid-fire time!

### Aberrant

Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Tube Man. You are a 6-hit-point class, you don’t want to be anywhere near the fight. Tentacular Limbs does just this. Aberrant Whispers is a fantastic way to shut down spell casters and the flavor is perfect. This was my first Sorcerer and I had a blast, enjoy the AWESOME.

### Angelic

You picked this because you want the Divine Tradition for Healing, you might as well be the best at healing. Angelic Halo makes an already great spell even better. It makes the three-action version of Heal really strong (and less variable. Always a win)

### Demonic

Glutton’s Jaw is the Unarmed Attack that Monks WISH they could have. Also, what a fantastic selection of spells. These spells are ones that change the course of a battle. Nothing not to love here.

---

### Diabolic

Diabolic Edict is literally a free bonus on anything you want. Want an ally to climb a wall? Diabolic Edict. Want an ally to attack a foe? Diabolic Edict. These are free bonuses that stack with a lot of stuff, take advantage.

### Draconic

The Dragon abilities need the least justification. You get fantastic resistance from Dragon Claws, then you get the ability to Breath damaging stuff on your foes, and then you can literally fly. The bonus spells here are also fantastic for doing all of the things Arcane casters want. Fire away.

### Elemental

Elemental Toss is a pretty high damage single-action ability. Also being able to do bludgeoning damage as a caster is something that is pretty rare and good for enemies that have resistances. Plus, I love Elemental Motion. Being able to quickly solve challenges like pits, water and tunneling is AWESOME.

---

### Fey

The Fey Bloodline is AWESOME. It gives you a lot of spells you wouldn’t have access to in the Primal Tradition and gives you the tools to fight when you need to and run away when you need to. The Anoint Ally feat works really well for the Fey Sorcerer and can give out free 20% miss chances to their friends. Really AWESOME all around (one of my favorites).

---

### Hag

Jealous Hex is a really impactful Focus Spell. Punishing the creature by hitting its best attribute is amazing. This spell is always useful. Stupefied directly hits their ability to cast spells. Even Stupefied 1 causes a 20% spell failure chance. The target never becomes to immune to this effect, so you keep it up as often as you can. The Blood Magic effect is also super fun. Punish enemies for hitting you.

---

### Imperial

Imperial is a cool bloodline. Being able to just be trained in a skill on a whim is really helpful for things like Rituals, getting over obstacles, and stuff like Aid. Extend Spell is a really cool Metamagic Spell to keep things like Blur, Haste, Chromatic Armor, etc. active.

---

### Undead

You get to be a half Undead person, it’s sweet. Undeath’s Blessing is really powerful when you’re fighting an enemy that is using the 3-action Harm spell (which happens more often than you think). Regardless, if you want to be a Harm caster, this is one of the best ways to do it. +2 HP per spell level is no joke. They also have one of the strongest Blood Magic effects in the game. Healing yourself or hitting harder is always a nice buff.

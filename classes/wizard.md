## The Wizard

Other spellcasting classes have been released after the Core Rulebook was released but none of them hold a flame to the Wizard. The Wizard can get four spells per spell list, a wide selection of school spells, and some really cool Thesis options. There is something like 64 possible Wizard combinations at Level 1 to choose from. I’m going to talk about the Thesis options but honestly, it doesn’t do the Wizard’s AWESOMENESS justice. If you want to be an Arcane caster, you can’t do better than the classic Wizard.

### Improved Familiar Attunement
It’s clear that Familiars were designed for spellcasters. The Wizard doubles down on the concept by getting Familiars with more abilities for free. You can get AWESOME specific Familiars with this without much investment and alone gives you ton of tools to play with. Use it to pick up extra Cantrips/Spells, have a Skill buddy, get extra senses or so much more. Think of the Familiar as a bonus feat with a ton of options.

### Metamagical Experimentation
It shouldn’t be a surprise by this point that I love feats. This Thesis gives you some really cool feats for free. Feats like Widen Spell and Reach Spell are game changers when you need them but they are hard to pick up because you don’t get a Level 1 Feat by default. This opens that up for you. Conceal Spell and Silent Spell are really helpful in the right campaign. It’s a fantastic Thesis all around.

### Spell Blending
Spell Blending is an AWESOME Thesis. You get fewer spells overall but clearly, you want large, big, flashy, AWESOME spells. Go blow some people up and enjoy! Nothing more to say here.

### Spell Substitution
This is a really powerful Thesis for having a lot of flexibility. Since the Wizard can learn a ton of spells, being able to switch out spells and use them during the same adventuring day is AWESOME. There are a lot of situational spells in the game that punch above their weight class. This gives you access to those spells on-demand.

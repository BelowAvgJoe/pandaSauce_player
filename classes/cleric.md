## The Cleric

The Cleric has two Doctrines: The Cloistered Cleric and the Warpriest. They’re both AWESOME but don’t lose sight of the fact that you are a FULL CASTER in both cases. So the question becomes, do you want to rock out in sweet armor or do you want to rock out with dope spells?

## The Cloistered Cleric

Hot damn, you are fantastic at casting spells. You have healing power like no one else but that’s not even close to all you can do. Did you have a look at Searing Light? 10d6 on a Level 3 spell!?!? You’ll be melting bosses left, right, and center.

Did I forget to mention Focus Spells? Clerics have some of the most diverse selection of Focus Spells ever. You’ve got some great damage ones like the Fire Domain but you’ve got some other great options like freezing enemies with the Time Domain or proving your innocence in social situations with the Truth Domain.

Oh, speaking of flexibility. You’ve got the entire divine spell list at your disposal and you can pull from other spell lists via your Deity. Some gods like Nethys give you NINE spells from other traditions. The Cleric always has the right spell for the moment.

## The Warpriest

Your first comparison to the Warpriest might be the Champion. You might look at their proficiencies and not understand what the Warpriest has going for it. Well, everything I just said about the Cloistered Cleric applies here as well. You’re a full, flexible spellcaster with all of the answers at your fingertips.

You’ve got armor and Shield Block which are some defensive options that the Cloistered Cleric is sorely lacking. As the Cleric, you cannot afford to be dying on the ground and the Warpriest makes sure that doesn’t happen.

The Warpriest has access to some of the most powerful feats in the game for a caster. The Barbarian wishes it could have Replishments of War. The Fighter will beg you to take Eternal Blessing. Plus, who doesn’t love Channel Smite? AWESOME feats for an AWESOME subclass.

## The Druid

Holy moly the Druid is a flexible class. The Druid can transform into a Dinosaur (peak Pathfinder), cast a full array of spells, can be the party healer, have an animal companion, surf the waves, and more.

Actually, before I do, one last thing about Orders. You aren’t locked into one like you are with other subclasses. A Cleric can only be a Cloistered Cleric or a Warpriest. You have the option to pick between any or all of the Orders as you level up. Flexibility and expression are AWESOME.

### The Animal Order

You get an Animal Companion and I think Animal Companions are AWESOME. You can have a pet Wolf, Bear, Horse, or even a frikkin' Mammoth. How AWESOME is that!? Oh, that’s not even mentioning that you get a Focus Spell to keep them in the fight. You have your own glorified battle companion and that’s AWESOME.

Druids actually get the Animal upgrade feats earlier than all of the other classes so your companion will be ahead of the curve. Giving your animal a free action without your input at Level 4 vs Level 6 is a HUGE advantage. This continues to be true with feats like Side by Side (that gives you auto-flanking with Mounts).

Oh, did I mention that the Druids can get access to an Animal Companion that no one else can? The Arboreal Sapling is a badass Plant Companion.

## The Leaf Order

There is A LOT to love here. Having a Familiar is awesome for a spell caster and gives you access to some fantastic abilities. Goodberry is out of combat healing that you might be lacking (if you go a Druid, it is less likely that someone in your party will pick a Bard or a Cleric).

As you level, you’ll gain the ability to talk to plants which can be super helpful. Being able to have information during a mystery where you “shouldn’t” be able to is really strong. Most GMs will be happy to give out information if you invest feats into it.

You just have a lot of options with the Leaf Order because you get such a strong foundation, you’re able to go in pretty much whichever direction you want. Take advantage!

### The Storm Order

Do you like Lightning and gigantic damage dice? Tempest Surge is one of the highest damage-dealing Focus spells in the game and you get two Focus points right off the bat. AWESOME. Being able to ignore rain and fog is actually pretty good when the situation calls for it. You don’t want anything interrupting those sweet lightning bolts.

Speaking of sweet lightning bolts, eventually, you get the ability to cast Tempest Surge as a reaction and the ability to Fly. I don't need to tell you how AWESOME a flying, lightning bolt-wielding face melter is, do I? You know what happens to your enemy when it gets struck by Lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else. RIP enemies.

## The Wild Order

One of the purest joys in Pathfinder is becoming a Dinosaur every fight and wrecking your opponents. Welcome to the Wild Order. You gain the Wild Shape feat which lets you become Pests, other animals, dinosaurs, birds, otherworldly beings, etc. You start just being able to be a pest which makes you a fantastic scout. Eventually, you'll get a ton of options that makes you a true shape-shifting marvel.

Wild Morph is great too. You gain some awesome combat abilities and you retain the ability to cast all of your AWESOME spells. Wild Morph is AWESOME in the early game when you want to get in the fight directly and AWESOME for the late game when you want wings, 10-foot reach, and insane bleed damage. Lots of AWESOME to be found here.

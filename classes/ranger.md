## The Ranger

Back into the land of subclasses and boy oh boy do we have some doozies here. The Ranger is arguably defined by their subclass more than any other class and they come with some staggering benefits. As I’m going through these options, remember that if you get an Animal Companion, they also benefit from these Subclasses. Animal Companions aren't required but the Ranger gives them some very unique benefits.

## The Flurry Ranger
While all of the other classes in the game have to suffer from a gross multi-attack penalty for making a ton of attacks, you don’t. The Flurry Ranger can make multiple attacks at a much, much lower penalty. If your second attack is an Agile weapon, your multiattack penalty is only -2. This is insanity. This is more or less the same as you attacking twice in the first place. If you happen to have a flanking partner (like an Animal Companion mentioned above), you’re basically getting another free attack without a penalty.

There are actually a lot of ways to build a Flurry Ranger. The most obvious one is to get into their face with two weapons. This is easy and hits like a truck. Another way is to ignore the part about the weapon being agile and attack with a bow. Who cares if it’s at a higher penalty if you don’t need to risk your safety? Fire away and stay protected.

Both options will help you stick a ton of damage reliably which is completely AWESOME. Hit often and make that damage pile up.

### The Precision Ranger
While the Flurry Ranger is really good at attacking a lot, the Precision Ranger can deal massive, single, big hits. This lets you do things like popping out of cover, taking a single shot, and then ducking back into cover. It also lets you focus on weapons that deal massive critical hits like Picks or Longbows and takes advantage of the fact that the Precision Damage also doubles.

Remember what I said about Animal Companions above? Well, it works really, really well for the Precision Ranger. Normally an animal will have to move and then only get to attack once. Not helpful for the Flurry Ranger but great for the Precision Ranger. Since you don’t “share” a Precision bonus, both of you can inflict that sweet, sweet Precision damage in the same turn. AWESOME. I played with a Precision Ranger and a Bat Companion and I was stunned by how often the enemies just didn’t get a turn. You’re one critical hit away from just ending a fight.

### The Outwit Ranger
Here is a very spicy subclass. While the other two are very obvious about how they deal damage, the Outwit Ranger is more subtle. You gain bonuses to Deception, Intimidation, Stealth, and Recall Knowledge. Your goal with this subclass is to never, ever fight without some sort of advantage over your foe.

There is a feat in the game called Monster Hunter that gets overlooked because it has a bunch of text about you scoring a critical Recall Knowledge. Completely ignore that. Monster Hunter lets you open up the combat with a Recall Knowledge (one of the things you're great at). Now that you know some stuff about them, you’re free to either Intimidate them, Sneak up to them or Feint them out (based on the situation).

Here are some pro-tips. Frightened is a Status Penalty and Flat-Footed is a Circumstance Penalty. They stack. Take advantage of Intimidate and Deception to drop an enemy’s AC quickly. If you attack from Stealth, the enemy is also Flat-Footed so you’ve got a lot of opportunities to get that sweet bonus to hit.

Here’s another thing that is overlooked. The Outwit Ranger is really, really good in social situations. Most people think of the Ranger as only a damage dealer and a woodsman-type character but Outwit doesn’t agree. Recall Knowledge, Deception, and Intimidate are all fantastic in a social setting. There isn’t anything hostile about Hunt Prey so use it whenever you can.

Oh, and eventually Rangers get the ability to make any Recall Knowledge check against Creatures with Nature. Outwit knows everything about everyone.

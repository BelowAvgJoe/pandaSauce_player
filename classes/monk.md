## The Monk

Another flexible class with a great kit. The Monk doesn’t have subclasses but starts out with a keystone ability: Flurry of Blows. Flurry of Blows gives you two attacks for one action that really frees you up to do other things. Take advantage of the ability to move around, use a Shield, apply Battle Medicine, Intimidate, etc.

The Monk is also the only class that starts with Expert in all of their Saves and their Unarmored Defence. The Monk is a survivable class that can wiggle themselves out of a lot of situations. They quickly get a ton of speed so they can become the masters of hit-and-run tactics or use their AC to stay within the enemy’s range and mess them up.

One of the coolest things about the Monk is their stances. Like the Fighter before them, you can choose a Stance like the Fighter can choose a weapon. They give you cool abilities like free Feints, free Trips, free Intimidates, climb speeds, massive scary roars, elemental damage attacks, and the ability to use Flurry of Blows with a bow (Flurry of Bows). I could write an entire article as long as this one about the different Monk stances. Take a look at them but don’t also feel obligated to pick one. The Monk has a bunch of other options too that don’t involve them entering Stances every fight.

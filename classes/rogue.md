## The Rogue

Ah, one of my favorite classes. The Rogue is a fantastic class for having options available. Rogues big gimmicks are that they have Sneak Attack (a high damage dealing ability that works whenever someone is flat-footed) and they get Skill Feats every level. This is AWESOME. I’m not going to get into all of the Skill Feats here but hit me up if you want to hear some cool combos.

All right, let’s dive into one of the most diverse sets of subclasses in the game.

### The Ruffian

Oh boy, the Ruffian. The Ruffian is a funny one to start with because it really doesn’t align with the sneaky rogue that most people picture, but trust me, it is a Rogue through and through.

They get Simple Weapons, Medium Armor, and the ability to pick Strength as their key ability score. This really helps your damage output. Being able to charge in with a long spear and hit for a ton of damage is awesome. I haven't spoken a lot about the Critical Specializations because they aren’t normally something most classes have access to at Level 1 but the Ruffian does. The Ruffian is really good at applying stacking effects.

Speaking of stacking effects, the Ruffian is also great at applying Frightened to the enemy. Pick up Dread Striker to make every Frightened foe flat-footed to you.

The Rogue is the best class to cheaply apply status conditions to the enemy and the Ruffian is the best at making those status conditions hurt.

### The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a really cool subclass. I really like Feint as an option and the Scoundrel makes it last a really long time. Being able to inflict two turns of Flat-Footed WITHOUT A MULTI-ATTACK PENALTY is AWESOME. Plus, since you can take Charisma as your free attribute, all of the things I said above about Intimidation hold true here (Remember, Frightened and Flat-Footed stack).

Also, the Scoundrel is one of the few classes that can apply a penalty to Reflex Saves. With their Level 2 Feat, Distracting Feint. If you have a blaster caster in the party, this is an invaluable ability. (This also stacks with Frightened).

You are the best “Face” Rogue meaning you are really good in Social Situations. Hopefully, you’ll be able to stop a few fights before they even start and if you can’t, make them suffer for it.

### The Thief Rogue

The Thief Rogue is the only class that gets to add their Dexterity to damage in the entire game. This can help them hit like a truck and still be good at all of the things that Dexterity offers (Reflex Saves, AC, etc.). Their ability also works with any Finesse weapon so if you are able to get a Finesse weapon from an Ancestry like the Elven Curved Blade, you can hit like a truck. AWESOME.

Thief Rogues, like the other two above, are really good at inflicting status conditions. Their Unbalancing Blow feat really helps keep an enemy flat-footed and things like Reactive Pursuit ensure that once you close on an enemy, they WILL die.

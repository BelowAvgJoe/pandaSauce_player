## Bard

Before I get into the Muses, can you believe that Paizo made a full spellcaster with three spells per spell level and then decided “Let’s give them one of the best Cantrips in the game”?

Welcome to the Bard. You are one of the best force multipliers in the game. The Occult Spell List is filled with mind-melting goodies. I’ll leave that to you to look through though, I’m here to talk about the Muses.

### The Enigma

Was 6 + Intelligence Modifier Skills not enough for you? What if you just had a Lore Skill that knew everything about everything? That’s Bardic Lore. Enigma is awesome because you have the Knowledge aspect covered right from the start.

Oh did I mention that Bards get a feat to Recall Knowledge six times for one action? You just start every battle knowing everything about your foe. Hope they didn’t have any weaknesses because you’ll know it and know how to tear your enemies to shreds.

## The Maestro

Remember how I said that Bards get one of the best cantrips in the entire game? Well, what if you only needed to cast it once per fight?

Welcome to the Maestro Muse. They make Inspire Courage and all of your other compositions last way longer than they have any right to. Don’t want them to last longer and want them to hit harder? No problem, let me tell you about Inspire Heroics. It cracks up your Inspire Courage and Inspire Defence and it doesn’t even take an action. You might fail sometimes but it doesn’t even cost you a Focus Point if you fail. Absolutely bonkers. Inspire Heroics combined with a debuff like Synthesia can give the whole party an effective +6 to hit. AWESOME.

### The Polymath

In Pathfinder, when you’re leveling up, you have to make a choice about where to put your Skill Proficiency increases. The Polymath Muse literally doesn’t care when it comes to Diplomacy, Intimidation, and Deception. You’re great at all of them. Being able to keep four skills “maxed out” as your level is crazy. Not even the Rogue can keep up with that.

Polymath Muses are one of the most flexible spontaneous casters and have a bunch of feats to help them get more signature spells. More options is more power in Pathfinder.

## The Warrior

Here’s the thing. Martial Weapons just hit harder than Simple Weapons. Using a bow over a crossbow is going to make a big difference if you want to shoot enemies. While I’ve tried to avoid talking about archetypes here, this one opens up the Marshal which is just too sweet to ignore for a battlefield commander.

Speaking of being an AWESOME battlefield commander, the Warrior Muse gets a bunch of feats to let your allies move or attack at the cost of a reaction. When you make them Strike, it’s without a multi-attack penalty. Most martials would pay half of their gold to get a free attack without a multiattack penalty. You’ve got so much AWESOME, it’s good to share it with friends.

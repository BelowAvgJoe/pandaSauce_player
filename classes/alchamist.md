## The Alchemist

The Alchemist has four Field Researches that each help you find the AWESOME in a unique way. They cover a lot of different areas. Consumables are one of the strongest class of items in the game and the Alchemist goes all in. Let's break them down

### The Bomber
Do you want the ability to make a million bombs and throw them at people? Look no further than the Bomber. Need more AWESOME bomb facts to get you hyped?

Bombs still do their splash damage on a fail. Wouldn’t it be a shame if Balor had 20 weakness to Cold damage? Bombs some of the highest Persistent Damage in the game and Persistent Damage of different types stack. Persistent Damage from Bombs also doubles on Critical Hits. Enjoy watching the smile fade from your GM’s face when their monsters melt.

What else is there to say? Bombs are AWESOME.

### The Chirurgeon
This Research Field just got a buff to make it more AWESOME. You are the Ultimate Doctor.

You get a TON of free Healing items every day. There is never a time you’ll be walking into a fight without a bunch of healing elixirs in hand. Antidotes are one of the most commonly overlooked AWESOME items in all of Pathfinder. The Level 1 Antidote doesn’t get outclassed by Runes until LEVEL FOURTEEN and they last for SIX HOURS. You know what’s better than being poisoned? Not being poisoned. Give this to your party and watch the poison effects fade away.

If that wasn’t enough, you get to just completely ignore an entire skill. Medicine? Throw it in the trash. You’ve got Crafting. You’re going to be using Battle Medicine with your best stat and best skill proficiency.

At Level 7, you get free, unlimited healing items. The silly Champion can only use Lay on Hands on one person at a time here and then they have to Refocus. You’ve got free, unlimited healing items for the whole party AND can Treat Wounds at the SAME TIME. Healing the entire party is AWESOME for the Chirurgeon.

### The Mutagenist
The Mutagenist is AWESOME. While all the rest of the boring Research Fields are healing and staying back, you’re growing a mouth full of jaws and charging headlong at the enemy.

Oh, wait what? That’s just the stereotype and Mutagenists can do a TON more stuff than that. AWESOME.

First off, Mutagens are items that give you benefits that punch above their weight class. Mutagens give you item bonuses that are higher than what other items get with a drawback. Oh, by the way, the Mutagenist can just choose to remove the drawback and heal themselves with Revivifying Mutagen.

It's impossible for me to fully explain the AWESOMENESS of this subclass without giving into all of the base Mutagen options... so HERE WE GO.

The Juggernaut Mutagen gives you a ton of temporary hit points and gives you a bonus to Fortitude Saves. Knock one of these back when you’re suffering from a poison and just watch it disappear or use it when you’re being hit hard by a boss. Once the Temporary Hit Points are gone, use Revivifying Mutagen and reapply.

The Quicksilver Mutagen gives you fantastic Stealth, Acrobatics, Thievery, and insane speeds. You should always be sneaking around with this. Once a fight breaks out, use Revivifying Mutagen to get rid of that health penalty or stay at range and punish them with Bombs (which are buffed by this mutagen).

The Bestial Mutagen turns you into a killing machine. Do you want a zero-handed D12 unarmed attack? Monks wish they had a fraction of your power. The haters will quote stats about your lack of AC. Blah blah blah. Do you know what the best defense is in Pathfinder? All of your enemies being dead. Kill them before they kill you. I don’t think there is a more awesome mentality than that.

The Cognitive Mutagen is a Mutagen that you might as well have around. In Pathfinder you aren’t going to have an item bonus for everything. Items are EXPENSIVE. Do you know what isn’t expensive? This fun little Mutagen. Drink it up and be good at everything Recall Knowledge. Wanna know another fun little trick? Pick up Dubious Knowledge, drink a Cognitive Mutagen and then just use Recall Knowledge. You might fail but you’ll get a piece of true information. There is literally no limit to this. You could have a DC50 Recall Knowledge check and you are Level 1, you’ll still get a piece of true information. Knowing stuff is AWESOME. (Your GM won't find this as AWSOME as you do)

The Serene Mutagen is one of those Mutagens that is really great when you need it. Keep this for when you’re facing off against a haunt or a fear effect. A bonus to Perception is also really helpful when you’re looking for traps or secret doors. If you really, really can't afford to miss something, keep one of these handy.

The Silvertongue Mutagen is my fave. In Pathfinder, an attitude only decreases if you critically fail a social check. This makes that impossible. This is an AWESOME perpetual infusion. Keep your idiot Barbarian’s drink topped up and they won’t embarrass themselves. If a fight happens to break out, open up with an Intimidate and start your enemies off on the back foot.

And that’s just the base Mutagens. This doesn’t even go into the Drakeheart, Warblood, or any of the others. Not to mention there are 200+ Alchemical items coming in the next book. I bet more than a few of them will be Mutagens.

### The Toxicologist
This is one of the only non-Core things I decided to include because I think it's AWESOME. (I love Alchemists, okay?)

Poisons just do a TON of damage. They can apply status effects and you make them plentiful.

There are a few subtle things about poisons that actually make them WAY better than you might think.

First off, while poisons have a duration, that is only the duration they are active BEFORE being applied to a weapon. Just like a Mutagen keeps affecting you after you drink it, a poison remains applied to your weapon after you use it. This is even more AWESOME when you get Perpetual Infusions. When you apply a poison to a weapon you’re holding, it uses your Class DC instead of the Poison’s DC. This keeps even weak poisons as small but relevant boosts to damage. If you aren’t applying one of your top-tier poisons to a weapon in your possession, you should make sure it has a Perpetual Infusion Poison on it.

Secondly, if you hit an enemy using a poison that they are already afflicted with, you force them to make a new save. Nothing happens if they pass this save, but the effect gets worse if they fail. Stacking poison hits can get the stages up VERY quickly. The Bombers aren’t the only Research Field that can make enemies melt.

Poisons are poisons. Poisons are AWESOME. Nothing much more to say here.

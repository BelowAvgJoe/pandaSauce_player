## The Fighter

The Fighter doesn’t really have the subclasses like the other classes so far do, but it has a really, really strong chassis on its own and the flexibility to pick whatever fighting style you want.

The Fighter has a higher weapon proficiency bonus than any of the martial classes. This might not seem like a lot at first glance, but trust me, it is AWESOME.

You can critically hit when you exceed the target’s AC by 10 or more. No one is better equip to do this than the Fighter. You’ll become the king of crits very quickly. Remember that the best enemy is a dead enemy.

Some cool builds for you to try with the Fighter are:

- The Sword and Board Fighter: Get a Sword and a Shield and take advantage of Shield Block. Pick up Aggressive Block and get the enemy’s face.
- The Free-Hand Fighter: The Fighter has some of the best feats that reward keeping a hand free. On top of being able to use tools, you’ll be able to make your enemy flat-footed, grab them, and push them around. It’s a lot of fun.
- The Two-Handed Fighter: You know what hurts? Being hit by a d12 damage dice. Go grab yourself a Greataxe or a Greatsword and just hit your enemies. You’d be surprised how many enemies have a crippling weakness to damage to the face.
- The Pick Fighter: If you’re going to Crit all of the time, you might as well make them hurt as much as possible. Pick up a Pick and take advantage of that Fatal trait.

There are dozens of others you could pick from but there is another freeform class coming up so let’s get ready to move on. My advice for wrapping up the Fighter is, go check out the Weapon traits and see which align with your play style, and don’t be afraid to try out a bunch of weapons.
